Kotlin & Jetpack Compose application about books.

## :information_source: General info
<p align="justify"> 
This application was built using the Big Book API, which provides detailed information about a wide range of books. Users can sign in using SMS-based phone number authentication, handled through Firebase Authentication. After logging in, users land on the HomeScreen, where they can browse through dozens of book categories. Selecting a category filters the book list to show only relevant titles. Additionally, a search bar is available to help users find specific books by title or keyword. The HomeScreen also features a simple settings button, giving users the ability to either log out or permanently delete their account. On the Search screen, a list of matching books is displayed based on either the selected category or the entered search query. When a user selects a book, the app navigates to a BookDetails screen, where more in-depth information is shown — including the book's description, release date, and average rating.
